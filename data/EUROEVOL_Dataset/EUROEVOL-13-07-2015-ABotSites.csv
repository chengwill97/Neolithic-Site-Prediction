"the site is in the Vallon de Marcieu located on the edge of the eastern massif; in the 1980s and 1990s the team of Grenoble ""Alpine Settlement and Palaeoenvironment"" survey group found many sites in Chartreuse and Vercors (under the direction of P. Bintz and R. Picavet); in the context of these findings the excavation programmed for ALP 1 was initiated in 1994 first under the direction of P. Bintz, then from 1999 that of D.

"Abri Pendimoun is about 4 km north of Menton and less than 1 km from the Franco-Italian border - the shelter is exposed to west and opens on the left bank of a small trough, at an altitude of 690 m; first excavated in 1955 and 1956 by Louis Barral and team of Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology Monaco; previous work showed that the archaeological layers extended beyond the cliff overhang however it was difficult to estimate of the surface area of prehistoric occupations; because of loss due to the earlier excavation and natural truncations of anthropogenic deposits the maximum exetent of occpation is estimated to be approximately 60 m2 in which undisturbed layers have been preserved; present report based on exavations from 1985 to 1990 which concerned an area in the shelter of about 25 m2 (only 6 m2 were fully excavated during this period); this phase included the implementation of diverse sampling strategy mainly for the evaluation of paleoenvironmental materials (sedimentology, micromorphology, palynology, carpology, anthracology malacology); archaeobotany: initially there was bulk sampling in the square M 16 and processing on sieves with meshes of 0.5 mm and 2 - plant materials collected in this context were relatively few given sieved volumes (176 liters) but the location of samples in an area not protected by the overhanging rock and affected by bioturbation which was more intense than elsewhere could explain the paucity of remains; after this the sampling was extended to other areas: sampling method consisted on site of the separation of the fine fraction on a 1 mm mesh and systematic wet-sieving of the coarse fraction (this method limits the volume and weight of samples to be handled) - flotation of these samples was conducted in laboratory on two meshes of 2 and 0.5 mm; currently, more than 1200 liters of sediment have been floated; all remains are charred and lists of taxa (Cardial and Impressa) are given in two tables (V, VI, 217-218) - I've entered these data in the db (excluding the remains found in the 2 burials because there appears to be uncertainty about provenance)",S3277,wet-sieving,"2.0mm, 0.5mm",NULL

"in connection with the excavations at the site Sjaellandsvej V (Hem 4357) at Brande that took place in the spring of 2007 there were a number of houses and other structures from different periods; among other things, uncovered two twin-aisled houses with semi-recessed floors; in one of the empty ones (House 319) there were in part a cultural layers measuring 10x6.3m and an eastern recess c.6.5 x5.5m - the bottom layer in the recess at an early stage during excavation work was found to contain large quantities of charred cereal grains; layers 321 and 322 were sampled for a/bot analysis; samples were floated at the Herning Museum; the author notes that the data presented in table 2 are based on a relatively quick assessment - the stated figures in the table should be seen as assessments only and not exact values; on the basis of the assessed samples from Sjaellandsvej V they were found to conatain very large amounts of charred cereal grains - the evaluated samples are therefore estimated to contain a total of just less than 20 liters of charred cereal [sample X518 comes from layer 322 in the east, recessed part of the house, while X365 comes from the western layer 321]",S9207,"machine flotation",0.25mm,NULL
"in connection with the excavations of VMAA 2405 Tandrupgaard in 2003 carried out by archaeologist Bjarne Henning Nielsen traces of a north-south-oriented house were found dating to the late Single Grave culture as well as a farm from the Early Iron Age; during the excavation a number of soil samples macro fossil analysis were taken from the Late Neolithic house and two from the farm; the samples were made available by Vesthimmerlands Museum, Aars and were floated at Skive Museum's archaeological Department of Hoejslev; the samples from the house from the late Single Grave Culture were taken from all roof postholes, each wall and gable post holes and various pits, which are interpreted as being in use in the building's occupation; the pits are inside the house-yard which was found to be  very ""clean"" ",S9208,"machine flotation","8.0mm, 2.0mm, 0.5mm",NULL
"the site Teglvaerksvej 31 located at Aalestrup west of Hobro and south of Ars; the site was excavated by Viborg Museum and it comprised one three-aisled house site from the Bronze Age II period (or period III); the house was not disturbed by other prehistoric structures, however there were a few non-contemporaneous pits at the house and traces of a possible house further west - also a number of fire/cooking structures were found, some of which probably had been in use while the house was occupied while others are earlier or later (Mikkelsen 2005); the samples made available by Viborg Museum and were all floated in Viborg Museum - all remains are charred; roof and wall post-holes were sampled as well as partition door posts, hearths and fire/cooking pits; I've excluded samples: K56, K63, K64, which are thought not to be contemporary with the house, and samples x66-x68, which are of unknown provenance; the wall post-hole K37 is the richest of the contexts and contains c.5600 whole cereal grains (c.9000 fragments)",S9209,"machine flotation",0.5mm,NULL
"only one soil sample was taken from ESM 1658 Uglviggard, which was excavated in 1990 by archaeologist Pallet Siemen; the sample originates from an earthenware pot from a post hole in a house from the Single Grave Culture; the sample was made available by Esbjerg Museum; the sample from Uglviggard was processed at Moesgaard Museum, since the sample was very small (3 l) it was floated in the laboratory using a basin of water and a net with a mesh size of 0.25 mm; 200ml of the residue (total volume 1200ml) was scanned and the results are also listed in table 2 (I've not included the residue in the db totals)",S9210,"bucket flotation",0.25mm,NULL
"in the fall of 2010, the Skanderborg Museum completed an archaeological excavation of a 6800 m2 area in Vrold; the excavations uncovered 5-7 houses, two of which are possible Neolithic midtsulehus? and one a sunken house site from the early Bronze Age; samples were processed at Moesgaard  museum; Late Neolithic (sample X10): 3 sub-samples were taken from grain finds X10- in the present investigation just one sample of 3 x10 subsamples are analyzed; X10 is selected from the pit A584 which is located in field immediately south of a possible Neolithic midtsulehus?; the pit consists of several layers, and the dark bottom layer was filled with charred organic material - indicative of burning in situ; two 14C dates of charred cereal grains of emmer (Triticum dicoccum) from x10 both dated the pit between 1900-2000 BC - i.e., the layer is attributable to the Late Neolithic; 2 samples from the EBA house are examined: X42 - this sample was taken from the fill in the recessed portion of the longhouse K5; the sample is likely to reflect plant material that has accumulated during the period of use of the building; 2 initial 14C dates of a sample of barley (Hordeum vulgare sp.) and indeterminate grains (Cerealia indet.) gave dates spanning approx. 1500-1770 BC indicating that X42 is from the oldest part of the Bronze Age; X47 is taken from a pit (A1135) in the northern corner of the longhouse K5; the pit is interpreted as a probable basement pit that belonged to the longhouse; 2 initial 14C dates of cereal grains, respectively emmer/spelt and naked barley provided dates spanning the period ca. 1600-1750 BC which corresponds well to the date of x42, confirming the connection between the two areas/contexts",S9211,"machine flotation",0.25mm,NULL
