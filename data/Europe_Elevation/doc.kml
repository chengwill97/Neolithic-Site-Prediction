	<description><![CDATA[<h1>Processed SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Data (DEM) Version 4.1</h1></P>

<P><I>Welcome to TOPOVIEW : the Google Earth interface for the SRTM data.</I><BR/>
If you tick 'Elevation' under 'Temporary places',
each of the grids that you see represents a 5 by 5 degree tile
and contains a placemark which links to approx. 90m resolution
digital elevation data. The data originate in the NASA Shuttle
Radar Topographic Mission <A HREF="http://srtm.usgs.gov/">(SRTM)
</A>data held at the <A HREF="http://seamless.usgs.gov/">National
Map Seamless Data Distribution System </A>. The data have been
processed by <A HREF="http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/">Dr. Andrew Jarvis
of the CIAT Land Use project </A>, in collaboration with H.I. Reuter, A. Nelson and E. Guevara
to fill in data voids and produce a seamless mosaic.<p>
This is version 4.1 of the CSI-SRTM data with improved hole-filling algorithms which
make use of ancilliary data sources where they are available. <p>

See the full documentation at CGIAR-CSI <A
HREF="http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/">here. </A> The data are available here
for download or  visualisation as Google Earth overlays using a locally- or
globally-specific legend. The original 5 degree tiles are also sub-tiled for those
users requiring easier to manage grids for smaller areas. The  visualisation, subtiling and Google Earth
KML interface were developed by <A HREF="http://www.ambiotek.com/stableurl/mulliganacad">Dr
Mark Mulligan of Kings College London </A>. The  actual data are
accessed from the  mirror servers at Kings College London.
The data are available in zipped ARCASCII and zipped GEOTIFF
formats, in the geographic coordinate system, WGS84 datum. Each tile has an
associated MASK file that indicates the areas in which data holes
have been filled.</P>

<P><B>To use simply </B><I>Fly To</I><B> your location and click
the nearest waypoint. </B>You will then see a balloon which allows
you to preview or download the five degree tiles of data. Previewing the data will
open a new network link and a series of &gt;100km sub-tiles which display
the data as a ground overlay. The data can be displayed with a
colour classification derived from the local five degree tile (a
local legend) or one which is consistent between five degree tiles
(a global legend). Use the global legend if comparing across five
degree tiles and the local legend if working within a single five
degree tile (to give the most detailed visualisation). You can also
download the data for the sub-tiles if these are easier for you
to work with than the larger five degree tiles.  These sub-tile data
are available as zipped ARCASCII only.
<P>
This is version 4.1 of this interface. There is a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document <A HREF="http://www.ambiotek.com/topoview/faq.doc"> here.</A>
